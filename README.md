## Inverted Invaders

An overwhelming fleet of an alien hive-mind attacked Earth.

Humans defeated the invaders by pulling off the unimaginable:

_They destroyed the Queen with one insanely lucky shot._

That's the CNN story: In reality it wasn't luck.

Humanity sent a Red team forwards in time, and a Blue team backwards in time.

The 'Red team' - with the intel from the 'Blue team' - knew exactly what to do before the battle.

You were assigned to be part of the Blue Team.
