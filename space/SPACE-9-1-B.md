Ammo:     0
Time: 00:00
Queen: Alive
Battle: Alien forces are ready for battle

You see the alien fighters pouring back into their carriers.

The enemy is powering down their weapons, and lowering their shields.

The Queen's menacing dreadnaught is going back into cloaking mode from combat ready state.

The Red Team is going back to HQ for the briefing.

You successfully survived the battle until its beginning!

You gathered all the necessary information along the way!

You'll be able to brief the Red Team on:
- where the Queen will be,
- when the Queen's ship will decloak
- how they can pull off the lucky shot.

You won!
