Battle: Alien command chain is broken down

The explosion before the Red Team is reassembling into an alien ship.

The Red Team smashes into the alien behind them.

You get caught up in the Red Team's laser
going back to the cannon.

If that's not enough, millions of small shrapnels start to
reassemble into an alien spaceship, and those shred you in the process.

You won't be able to brief the Red Team.

The fabric of reality tears apart.
